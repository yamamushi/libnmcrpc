Namecoin RPC
============

libnmcrpc is a C++ library that allows C++ programs to interact with
the JSON-RPC interface of a running namecoind.  This can be used to
either perform arbitrary RPC queries directly, or programs can also
use some high-level predefined commands that are implemented into the
library already.

The low-level RPC interface should also be able to talk to Bitcoin or
other altcoins, although my focus with testing and development
is on Namecoin.

For building libnmcrpc, you need cURL [1] installed (for GNU/Linux systems
you need the -dev package) as well as JsonCpp, which can be found at [2].
