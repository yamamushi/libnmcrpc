Namecoin RPC
============

libnmcrpc is a C++ library based on Boost that allows C++ programs to
interact with the JSON-RPC interface of a running namecoind.  This can
be used to either perform arbitrary RPC queries directly, or programs
can also use some high-level predefined commands that are implemented
into the library already.

For building libnmcrpc, you need cURL [1] installed (for GNU/Linux systems
you need the -dev package) as well as JsonCpp, which can be found at [2].
