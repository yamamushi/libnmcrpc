Namecoin RPC
============

libnmcrpc is a C++ library that allows C++ programs to interact with
the JSON-RPC interface of a running namecoind.  This can be used to
either perform arbitrary RPC queries directly, or programs can also
use some high-level predefined commands that are implemented into the
library already.

The low-level RPC interface should also be able to talk to Bitcoin or
other altcoins, although my focus with testing and development
is on Namecoin.

For building libnmcrpc, you need cURL [1] installed (for GNU/Linux systems
you need the -dev package) as well as JsonCpp, which can be found at [2].
For the IDN functionality, also libidn [3] is necessary.

Note that the stable version 0.5 of JsonCpp did not work in my tests, it
is suggested to use the latest source from their Subversion repository.
